### ⚠️ Project Maintenance Update

Hi everyone! 😊

I wanted to let you know that I’m no longer actively using **Zig**, which means I don't have as much motivation to keep maintaining this project. That being said, I believe this project still has a lot of potential, and I would love to see it continue to grow! 

If you're passionate about Zig and would like to help maintain and improve this project, feel free to reach out. Your contributions and support would be greatly appreciated! 🙌

Thanks for your understanding and for being part of the community!
